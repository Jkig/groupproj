# some ideas we can make:

## OpenCV stuff:
* I'm also down for some openCV or PyTorch ideas:
* some things I was thinking about here were vr based, for example sign language to written/spoken for vr headsets
* the reverse is cool too.
* other openCV ideas are cool aswell

## I still like the api/notification thing we talked about
* phone notifications are best, but email, and text are cool too
* weather and stocks are a good place to start, maybe we start with a weather one to get it all working, then extend to stocks, as we need a lot more functionality to get that to work
